# FastAPI Learning Project: URL Shortener with Analytics

## Project Overview

A URL shortener API with analytics tracking that will help you learn FastAPI, Pydantic, async features, swagger docs, data validation, background tasks, caching, rate limiting, and Redis integration.

## Phase 1: Basic Setup and Core Functionality

- Set up FastAPI project structure with proper organization
- Install and configure latest stable FastAPI and Pydantic
- Install docker and use "docker compose" for project app and database
- Create basic models using Pydantic with type hints
- Implement URL shortening and redirection endpoints
- Add basic validation and sanitization for URL inputs
- Implement basic error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Check APIS documentation for correctness and completeness
- Set up basic logging for the application

## Phase 2: User Authentication and Advanced Validation

- Implement user authentication with JWT tokens
- Create user registration and login endpoints
- Add advanced validation with Pydantic validators
- Implement data sanitization for all inputs
- Create user-specific URL management (create, list, delete)
- Add password hashing and security best practices
- Implement proper error responses with detailed validation errors

## Phase 3: Async Features and Background Tasks

- Refactor synchronous code to use async/await patterns
- Implement async database operations
- Add analytics tracking for URL clicks
- Create background tasks for processing analytics data
- Implement scheduled tasks for data cleanup and maintenance
- Add middleware for request tracking and analytics collection

## Phase 4: Caching and Rate Limiting with Redis

- Install and configure Redis
- Implement API route caching for frequently accessed URLs
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Cache analytics data to improve performance
- Implement session management with Redis
- Add distributed caching for application data

## Phase 5: Advanced Features and Optimization

- Add advanced analytics features (geolocation, referrer tracking)
- Implement custom middleware for request processing
- Enhance API documentation with FastAPI's built-in docs
- Add performance monitoring and optimization
- Implement API versioning
- Prepare for deployment with Docker configuration
- Add comprehensive testing with pytest and async test cases

## Learning Focus Areas

- FastAPI routing, dependency injection, and request handling
- Pydantic models, validators, and serialization
- Python type hints and their practical application
- Async/await patterns in FastAPI
- Data validation and sanitization techniques
- Background task processing with FastAPI
- Redis integration for caching and rate limiting
- API security best practices
- Performance optimization techniques

This project is designed to be manageable in scope while covering all the features you want to learn. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing you to gradually implement and understand each concept.
